The AI engineer was tasked with developing and debugging a Telegram bot web application, LuvHive. The trajectory reveals an iterative process addressing initial deployment issues, core feature implementation (media uploads, social feed, stories), and persistent bugs in user experience. A significant recurring challenge was fixing  key inconsistencies and cleanup logic that repeatedly broke the user registration flow, which was ultimately traced to corrupted code and configuration mismatches between  and  directories. Subsequent efforts focused on refining UI components, particularly for media display, reaction handling, and core functionalities like delete and reply, with repeated user feedback highlighting recurring issues. The engineer meticulously debugged and refactored code across both frontend and backend to align with user expectations and technical requirements.

<product_requirements>
The LuvHive application is a social/dating Telegram bot web app. Initial requirements included a welcome page with key metrics, a main feed with Following, Discover, Vibes, and Sparks tabs, story circles, and post cards for user content (profiles, vibe tags, progress bars, text, images, engagement). Core functionality includes creating/sharing posts and stories with photo uploads. The user explicitly requested functional Share buttons, robust photo/video upload to Telegram's , correct display of uploaded media, avatar images instead of text, and adjusting client-side image limits. Later, requirements expanded to include video upload support (up to 50MB via , with compression), client-side compression for large media, a working registration flow that persists user data, functional delete and reply buttons, and a single-reaction like system for posts.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a recurring set of UI issues reported by the user. These include:
1.  **Delete button functionality**: The delete option in  was present, and  in  contained delete logic. The focus shifted to verifying if  is properly set or if there's an issue with user matching logic, preventing the delete action from working correctly.
2.  **Reply functionality**:  correctly uses an  callback, and  passes . The issue was identified that  was not actually updating the post's replies in the UI, which was fixed. The current nuance is checking if replies are now correctly displayed in the UI.
3.  **Avatar/DP display**:  was rendering  with  instead of , causing raw strings or placeholder initials to appear. The engineer fixed the avatar rendering logic and fallback span, and added a generating avatar utility for better fallbacks.
4.  **Full-screen media modal**: The modal exists, but the engineer was in the process of ensuring that clicking on images/videos correctly triggers this modal.

The AI engineer has performed multiple fixes across , , and  to address these UI issues, including fixing  to update state, improving avatar display logic with fallbacks, and setting up the reaction system. The application's UI is generally in a good state, with avatars and reaction buttons appearing correct after the latest round of fixes.
