## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Telegram Bot Framework**: Built using `python-telegram-bot` library (version 20.7) as the primary interface for handling user interactions, commands, callbacks, and message routing.

**Database Layer**: PostgreSQL database managed through direct `psycopg2` connections with connection pooling. The database stores user profiles, chat metrics, premium status, and administrative data. The system uses environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`) for connection configuration with fallback to individual connection parameters.

**Modular Handler System**: The application uses a distributed handler architecture where different functionality is separated into modules:
- Registration handlers for user onboarding
- Chat handlers for matching and messaging
- Profile handlers for user data management
- Settings handlers for user preferences
- Premium handlers for subscription management
- Admin handlers for administrative functions

**State Management**: The bot maintains runtime state through in-memory data structures (queues, sets, dictionaries) for active chat sessions and waiting users. User session data is temporarily stored in Telegram's `user_data` context during multi-step interactions.

**Queue-Based Matching**: Chat matching uses deque-based queues to manage waiting users, with separate logic for premium users and different matching preferences (gender-based, age-based, interest-based).

### Authentication & Authorization

**Admin System**: Admin access is controlled through a configurable set of Telegram user IDs stored in environment variables (`ADMIN_IDS`) with fallback to hardcoded defaults.

**Premium Status**: Premium features are managed through database flags with time-based expiration. Premium users get priority matching, advanced filtering options, and media sharing capabilities.

**User Registration**: Multi-step registration process collecting gender, age, interests, and activities through inline keyboard interactions. Registration state is managed through callback patterns and user data context.

### Data Architecture

**User Profiles**: Comprehensive user data including demographics, interests, preferences, chat metrics, and premium status stored in PostgreSQL with dynamic column addition for new features.

**Metrics Tracking**: Real-time tracking of user engagement including dialog counts, message statistics, ratings, and reports with daily reset capabilities.

**Premium Management**: Subscription handling through Telegram Stars payment system with different duration packages and referral capabilities.

### Key Design Patterns

**Callback-Based Navigation**: Extensive use of inline keyboard callbacks with structured naming conventions (e.g., `prof:gender`, `prem:pay:m1`) for UI navigation.

**Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Feature flags like `FAST_INTRO` to modify bot behavior and environment-based configuration for deployment flexibility.

**Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for database connections, default values for missing configuration, and error handling for transient failures.

**Modular Registration**: Separate registration system with interest selection, activity preferences, and profile completion workflows.

## External Dependencies

**Telegram Bot API**: Primary interface through `python-telegram-bot` library for all bot interactions, message handling, and payment processing.

**PostgreSQL Database**: Primary data persistence layer using `psycopg2-binary` for connection management. Supports both connection URL and individual parameter configuration.

**Telegram Stars Payment System**: Integration with Telegram's native payment system for premium subscription processing without external payment providers.

**Environment Configuration**: Relies on environment variables for:
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram bot authentication
- `DATABASE_URL`/individual DB parameters: Database connectivity
- `ADMIN_IDS`: Administrative access control
- `FAST_INTRO`: Feature flag for instant chat introductions

**Logging Infrastructure**: Uses Python's built-in logging system for application monitoring and debugging with configurable log levels.
